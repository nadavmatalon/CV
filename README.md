##About Me

Proven track record in delivering results in complex projects, 
problem solving and innovation strategy.

After co-founding two successful companies and acquiring a Master's degree 
in philosophy, I turned to coding and web-development as new and exciting 
challenges. 

Through the roller-coaster ride that is 
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)'s boot-camp, 
I was trained as a full-stack developer, learned sound programming principles 
&amp; methodologies, while expanding my technical skillset.

I also love modding (everything from circuit design, to 3D modeling to 
water cooling).
