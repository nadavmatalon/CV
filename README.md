##About Me

I'm a creative project manager with excellent leadership and communication skills.

After co-founding two successful companies and acquiring a Master's degree 
in philosophy, I turned to coding and web-development as new and exciting 
challenges.

Through the roller-coaster ride that is [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)'s 
boot-camp, I was trained as a full-stack developer, learned sound programming 
principles &amp; methodologies, while expanding my technical skillset.

In my spare time, I love teaching martial-arts, skiing, and designing, building 
&amp; modding personal computers (from circuit design to water-cooling and 
everything in between).
